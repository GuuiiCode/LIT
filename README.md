To run the application on your machine, you will need to follow the following steps:

 1. Have docker installed on your machine.
 
 2. Go to the folder where the project was downloaded, open the terminal and run the command `"docker-compose up"` in the project's root folder. This will cause docker to upload the database and back-end application.
 
 3. Inside the project folder in the `"Fron-End\lit-web"` directory, run the `"npm install"` command. After downloading the necessary packages, run the `"npm start"` to access the front-end.
